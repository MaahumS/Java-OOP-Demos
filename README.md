# Java OOP Demos

This repository showcases object-oriented programming concepts in Java using custom class definitions and driver (demo) programs. Each example demonstrates real-world object modeling, encapsulation, constructors, and modular design.

## Concepts Covered:
- `UML` design
- object instantiation
- accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods
- `no args constructors` and `full constructors` 
- overloading methods
- `Array` objects

## üì¶ Projects Included

### 1. Auto Class + Expense Calculator
**Files:** `Auto.java`, `SattarM_J5B.java`  
Defines a car with attributes like make, model, year, miles, and price. The demo program creates and displays car objects and calculates estimated depreciation and mileage costs.

### 2. Boat Class Demo
**Files:** `Boat.java`, `SattarM_J5A.java`  
Models a boat object with properties like registration number and value. The driver prompts the user for details and demonstrates constructor usage and method calls.
